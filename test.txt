The Basic Sciences and Preclinical Years PCOM students begin preparation for the world of clinical
medicine from their first day as medical students. The curriculum combines basic science and clinical
course content with integrated courses such as Cellular and Molecular Basis of Medicine, as well as
integrated approaches to the pharmacology, pathology, medicine and surgery related to respiratory,
genitourinary, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems.
The first two years lay the foundation with intense concentration on the basic sciences, anatomy,
biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology,
taught in integrated course units that emphasize clinical applications. PCOM also recognizes that medical
practice is more than science. Coursework in ethics and patient communication helps the student relate
well to patients, while content in medical law and public health prepares the student for the complex
world of private practice.
The basic sciences are complemented by instruction in clinical subjects such as internal medicine,
surgery, neurology, psychiatry, pediatrics, epidemiology, OB/GYN, family medicine, rehabilitation
medicine, geriatrics, radiology, oncology and physical diagnosis. The principles and practice of
osteopathic medicine are taught throughout the medical curriculum. All students attend small group
sessions during the first and second year to develop communication and diagnostic skills. These special
instructional activities include patient observation, case conferences and basic clinical skills workshops.

In addition, an active standardized patient and robotic simulation program introduces first and second
year students to patient care through examinations of patient actors in a simulated practice setting,
augmented by clinical exercises on high-tech human patient simulator manikins.
Clinical Education The last two years emphasize clinical training experiences. Philadelphia Campus
students are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
neighboring states. This unique training network comprises 58 affiliated hospitals, five Healthcare
Centers, numerous outpatient units and scores of physicians’ offices. These clinical settings become
teaching arms of the College; in effect, the Commonwealth is our campus. Students at the Georgia
Campus are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout Georgia and the Southeast.
The program is designed to afford progressive student responsibility for all phases of patient care under
the direction of experienced physicians. This includes history taking, physical examinations, daily patient
rounds, lectures, conferences and case presentations. Students rotate through services in medicine, family
practice, manipulative medicine, surgery, cardiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry,
otorhinolaryngology and office-based preceptorships. On elective clerkships, students may choose to
pursue special interests at other medical institutions anywhere across the nation. All students receive
additional training in osteopathic manipulative medicine during the third year.
One objective of the College is to encourage graduates to practice in communities where health care
services are most needed. Therefore, each student entering PCOM must be willing to accept clinical
education assignments throughout the region. Each senior student serves at least eight weeks in an underserved community clerkship. An alternative rural elective is offered to a limited number of students,
whereby the student may select an area of alternative health care delivery or a rural area of intense
medical need. In the past, students have chosen studies in India, Israel, Africa, Appalachia and Indian
Health Service sites.

DoctorofPharmacy
Philosophy
The PCOM School of Pharmacy – Georgia Campus curriculum emphasizes patient-centered care, a model
consistent with the applied emphasis of PCOM’s graduate and medical programs. The mission of the GA-PCOM
PharmD program is to educate caring, proactive pharmacists according to a practice model in which the
practitioner assumes responsibility for a patient’s medication-related needs and is held accountable for this
commitment. The program also responds to the need for pharmacists in the nation, the state of Georgia, and the
southeastern region. The program educates pharmacists who prepare and provide drug products and assume
responsibility for the rational use of drugs by contributing to the design, implementation, monitoring and
modification of therapeutic plans that will achieve defined goals and improve therapeutic outcomes.
Educational Goals
The GA-PCOM School of Pharmacy prepares generalist, entry-level pharmacists who are able to deliver highquality pharmaceutical care. To achieve this mission, students must develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes
that enable them to competently: (a) provide population-based and patient-specific pharmaceutical care, (b)
manage and use resources of the health care system, and (c) promote health improvement, wellness, and
disease prevention. While preparing pharmacy practitioners is the primary mission of the Doctor of
Pharmacy program, the program also provides an avenue by which students may explore a broad range of career
opportunities. The program therefore aspires to foster interest in the creation of new knowledge to enhance
patient health outcomes and quality of life and also to prepare students for further education.
Curriculum
The program is configured in a curricular format in which students complete:
1. the pre-professional phase (3 or 4 years) of general education, biomedical and pre-pharmaceutical sciences
instruction at undergraduate colleges
2. the last four years of pharmacy sciences and practice instruction at the GA-PCOM facility, as well as
clinical experiences at clinical sites throughout Georgia and the southeast.
Each term is a 13 week period, corresponding to the calendar used by the PCOM Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine
programs in both Philadelphia and Georgia. The extension of coursework over the three terms each academic
year provides the opportunity for the across-the-curriculum development of skills. The curriculum is composed
of courses in biomedical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, social/behavioral/administrative sciences, and
clinical sciences. A number of elective courses are available to allow students to enhance their knowledge of
pharmacy–related topics in specific areas. There are five Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE) in
which students are given exposure to pharmacy practices in a variety of different practice sites and begin their
hands-on experiences. The final year of the program consists of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences
(APPE) in which students are required to complete eight different rotations. These rotations consist of five weeks
in a particular pharmacy practice site.
Required rotations include:
– Medicine
– Ambulatory Care
– Hospital Practice
– Community Practice
Elective rotations will include rotations such as (but not limited to):
– Cardiology
– Infectious Diseases
– Pediatrics
– Compounding Pharmacy
– Pharmaceutical Industry Management
This curriculum, including active learning skills development time, is designed to develop the knowledge,
professional skills, professional attitudes and values that are required for an entry-level pharmacist.

of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive.
All federal financial aid funds are credited or returned in compliance with the Federal Return
Policy schedule.
In special circumstances, including medical/family emergency, military reservist activation, or
academic dismissal (or denial of academic appeal) based on a previous term's academic
performance, the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and/or the Chief Financial Officer
may authorize a full refund of tuition or a refund greater than what is applicable according to the
refund policy.

Return of Title IV Funds
The Financial Aid Office is required by federal program guidelines to recalculate
federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are

dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing more than 60 percent
of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be
recalculated in these situations.
If a student leaves the College prior to completing more than 60 percent of a
payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recalculates eligibility for Title
IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the
following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula:
Percentage of payment period or term completed = the number of days
completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment
period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days
in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid.
Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage
of unearned aid using the following formula:
Aid to be returned = (100 percent of the aid that could be disbursed minus the
percentage of earned aid) multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have
been disbursed during the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid
than was disbursed, the College would be required to return a portion of the
funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. Keep
in mind that when Title IV funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a
debit balance to the College.
If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would
owe the student a post-withdrawal disbursement that must be paid within 120
days of the student’s withdrawal. The College must return the amount of Title IV
funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date of the
determination of the date of the student’s withdrawal.
Refunds are allocated in the following order:
• Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans
• Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans
• Federal Perkins Loans
• Federal Graduate (PLUS) Loans
• Other assistance under this Title for which return of funds is required

Copyright Policy
It is the policy of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine to comply with the U.S.
Copyright Act of 1976. All PCOM faculty, staff, students are expected to act as responsible
users of the copyrighted works of others which includes making informed decisions based on the
fair use exemptions to the copyright laws.
U.S. laws protect the rights of individuals regarding their own works. The penalties for violation
of copyright law can range from college sanctions to civil and criminal prosecution. Persons who
copy and distribute copyrighted material without legal permission may be found liable for civil
or criminal copyright infringement. Civil penalties for federal copyright infringement provide for
significant financial compensation for damages such as $150,000 for each willful act. Criminal
penalties can be up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The College cannot protect
students, faculty or staff from a copyright complaint, and the college may also be required by law
to disclose information to a complainant for use in pursuing legal action. Copyright
infringement may also result in college-imposed sanctions for misconduct.
Federal copyright law protects “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium,”
which includes works of literature, music, drama, film, sculpture, visual art, architecture, and
other creative media. (Title 17, U.S.Code, Section 101.) Most works published after 1923
(except those authored by the U.S. Government) should be presumed to be copyright protected,
unless there is information or notice from the copyright holder that the work is in the public
domain Works published prior to March 1, 1989, generally require a copyright notice to be
protected, but those published on or after March 1, 1989 are not required for copyright
protection. Copyright Office Circular 22 explains how to determine the copyright status of a work.

The doctrine of "Fair Use" (section 107 of the U.S. copyright law) in limited situations permits
the use of a copyrighted work, including reproducing portions of that work, without the
copyright owner's permission. Section 107 of the Copyright Act establishes four basic factors to
be examined in determining whether a use constitutes a "Fair Use" under the copyright law.
These factors are:
a) The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or
is for nonprofit educational purposes;
b) The nature of the copyrighted work;
c) The amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole; and
d) The effect of the use in question upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.

No factor is determinative of a person's right to use a copyrighted work without permission.
Educational use alone is not sufficient to make the use in question a fair one.
Photocopies or other reproductions can be furnished only under certain conditions, if they will be
used solely for private individual study, scholarship, or research. Use of the reproduction for
other purposes may make the user liable for copyright infringement.
PCOM reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying request, if, in its judgment, fulfillment of
the order would involve violation of copyright law. (17 U.S.C. 207, and under title 17 of the U.S.
Code as amended by Pub. Law 94-553: 108, 702. Dated August 9, 1977).
PEER-TO-PEER FILE-SHARING
The College has implemented measures within the PCOM information system that prevent the
use of Peer to Peer file sharing applications on all campus network computers. However,
students should be aware of the implications and risks of using such applications on personal
computers.
Copying or distributing copyrighted media such as songs, movies, software, video games, text
and pictures, without authorization from the copyright owner may constitute copyright
infringement. The Copyright Owner has the right to control, within certain limits, how their works
are published, distributed, and sold, and the correlative right to be paid for the use of a work. A
number of copyright infringement lawsuits and subpoenas have been filed by major companies
and their respective industry associations, including the Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA), the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA) and the Software &
Information Industry Association (SIIA). Federal copyright law entitles the copyright holders to
seek statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each act of willful infringement (for example, each
song or movie illegally copied or distributed).

Vaccination Policies

Health Insurance
PCOM requires all students to be covered by health insurance, either th rough our student group
policy o r un der a p rivate insu rance (paren t, spo use, etc) with com parable coverage. To verif y
comparable coverage, students will be required to file a waiv er each year, during the annual July
Open Enrollment, identifying the other insurance.
PCOM’s group health insurance plans for students, their spouses and/or dependent children
under 19 are available through Independence Blue Cross. Students may enroll in the student
group plan during the annual July open enrollment period. Payment of the premium for coverage
is billed in installments with tuition bills each term.
If a student chooses to not enroll in PCOM’s insurance plan, a waiver must be filed each year to
verify that the student has obtained comparable insurance coverage. Waiver forms and additional
information about PCOM’s health insurance plan is available on the Health Insurance Channel
on Nucleus.
Questions about coverage may be directed to the Office of Student Affairs at 215-871-6870

Malpractice Insurance Coverage for All Students
Students are fully covered by Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine's professional
malpractice insurance while on all officially assigned hospital and health care center clerkships,
preceptorships, and electives approved by the College.
First and Second Year students participating in clinical opportunities outside of the regular
curriculum are covered by PCOM's malpractice insurance provided the clinical opportunity has
the approval of the Director of Clinical Education and/or Senior Vice President for Academic
Affairs.

STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES
PHILADELPHIA CAMPUS
There are several PCOM Health Care Centers in the community for students to utilize for

Drug and Alcohol Policies

COLLEGE POLICY ON DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE

It is the policy of PCOM to maintain an environment that is free of substance abuse by students,
faculty and employees. The policy includes the following:
a. Prohibition Against Unlawful Presence of Controlled Substances on Campus (refer to
campus policy section of this handbook).
b. Prohibition Against the Unauthorized Presence of Alcoholic Beverages (refer to campus
policy section of this handbook).
c. Prohibition Against Being Under the Influence of any Controlled Substance at off campus classes, seminars or off campus on clerkships or internships.
When a student is suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, that student will be
reported to the Student Affairs and appropriate actions will be taken. This may include referral to
counseling support programs, suspension or termination of enrollment at PCOM.

SUPPORT AVAILABLE

Graduate and professional education can be a time of great stress. A student may be unable to
successfully adapt to these stresses and engage in potentially harmful coping mechanisms such
as alcohol or drug abuse. The College Policy on Drug and Alcohol Abuse represents the intent of
the College to enable students to resolve substance abuse problems by requesting and receiving
compassionate, confidential professional assistance.
In an effort to help our students and to protect patients and others from the harm that an impaired
student may cause, PCOM's goals include:
1. Providing effective and compassionate assistance to the impaired student before
irreversible harm is done to his/her health, educational process, eligibility for licensure,
or ability to function competently upon graduation.
2. Providing a means by which the impaired student may request and receive confidential
professional
assistance without stigma or penalty, and thereby encourage self-reporting
and personal responsibility.
3. Enabling the impaired student to confront his/her problem and, where feasible, receive
effective therapy with minimal disruption of the student's education.
4. Establishing a process that focuses on counseling and therapy as a front-line approach
before disciplinary action is necessary.

SEEKING HELP

Students at the Philadelphia Campus concerned about their own potential substance abuse should
contact the Asst. Dean for Student Affairs or the College psychiatrist at 215-871-6870.
Students on the Georgia Campus concerned about their own potential substance abuse should

contact the Coordinator for Student Affairs at 678-225-7534 or the Talbot Recovery Center at
800-445-4232 or 770-994-0185.
Reports by Concerned Individuals
If a student suspects impairment of another student, Philadelphia Campus students should seek
guidance from the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs or the Campus Psychiatrist. Students on
the Georgia Campus should seek guidance from the Student Affairs Coordinator.
General Detection of the Impaired Student
At the discretion of the Senior VP for Academic Affairs, a student may be required to submit to
psychological assessment and/or a urine and/or blood screening to detect alcohol abuse or the
presence of illegal drugs based on reasonable suspicion of impairment. Medical professionals
will perform such assessments and toxicology tests with reports sent in confidence to the Senior
VP for Academic Affairs, at no cost to the student. If such screening measures detect
impairment, the Senior VP for Academic Affairs may remand the matter to the Student
Professional Conduct Committee. Students who have declined an assessment and/or recovery
plan will automatically be remanded to the Student Professional Conduct Committee for
dismissal proceedings.
In accordance with the College Disciplinary Policy, any student found guilty of the use, sale or
distribution of illegal drugs, either on-campus or off-campus will be subject to permanent
termination of enrollment.

LEGAL SANCTIONS

PCOM is in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local drug and alcohol laws, and
vehicle codes. Any student convicted of a drug-related offense will be suspended which includes
immediate termination of all forms of financial aid.
All students should be aware of the legal sanctions under state, local, and federal law for the
unlawful possession or distribution of prescription or illicit drugs and alcohol, as well as the
health risks associated with abuse of controlled substances or alcohol. The following is a review
of the legal sanctions under local, state, and federal law for the unlawful possession or
distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol:
DRUGS
PENNSYLVANIA STATE LAW:
1. The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. C.S.A. 780-101 et seq.,
sets up five schedules of controlled substances based on dangerousness and medical uses. It
prohibits the manufacture, distribution, sale or acquisition by misrepresentation or forgery of
controlled substances except in accordance with the Act as well as the knowing possession
of controlled substances unlawfully acquired. Penalties for first-time violators of the Act
range from thirty days imprisonment, $500 fine, or both for possession or distribution of a
small amount of marijuana or hashish, not for sale, to fifteen years or $250,000 or both for

the manufacture or delivery of a Schedule I or II narcotic. A person over eighteen years of
age who is convicted for violating The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic
Act, shall be sentenced to a minimum of at least one year total confinement if the delivery or
possession with intent to deliver of the controlled substance was to a minor. If the offense is
committed within 1,000 feet of the real property on which a university is located, the person
shall be sentenced to an additional minimum sentence of at least two years total
confinement.

2. The Pharmacy Act of 1961, 63 Pa. C.S.A. 390-8 makes it unlawful to procure or attempt to
procure drugs by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or subterfuge or by forgery or alteration of
a prescription. The first offense is a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one year's
imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both.
3. The Vehicle Code, 75 PA, C.S.A. 3101 et seq., which was amended effective July 1,1977,
prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, or both, if the
driver thereby is rendered incapable of safe driving. A police officer is empowered to arrest
without a warrant any person whom he or she has probable cause to believe has committed a
violation, even though the officer may not have been present when the violation was
committed. A person so arrested is deemed to have consented to a test of breath or blood for
the purpose of determining alcoholic content, and if a violation is found it carries the
penalties of a misdemeanor of the second degree, which includes imprisonment for a
maximum of thirty days.

GEORGIA STATE LAW:
"Controlled Substances" This broad category of illegal substance is defined in Drug
schedules I-V, Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.), Sections 16-13-25 to 16- 1329.1, including a long list of chemical compounds, opiates, hallucinogens, derivatives, isomers
and other materials. The State Board of Pharmacy may add new materials to the list as required.
"Dangerous Drugs" This is an even broader category of illegal substance and is defined in
O.C.G.A. 16-13-71, describing hundreds of chemicals and other compounds. The Georgia
General Assembly may add drugs to the list as required.

below.

A chart detailing the penalties for violating Georgia's Controlled Substances and Dangerous
Drugs law is in the Appendix of this handbook. A summary of the criminal penalties is listed

Criminal Punishment
a. "First offender" treatment for mere possession of minor amounts of a controlled substance or
dangerous drug. A person never before convicted of possession of a small amount of the above
material may, at the judge's sole discretion, be afforded first-offender treatment, resulting in no

entry of a plea of guilty and no record of any conviction, if the defendant successfully completes
a court-monitored comprehensive rehabilitative program (O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(a)).
b.

Possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. Imprisonment for 12 months or less and/or a fine
not to exceed $1,000, or "public works" (community services) not to exceed 12 months
(O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(b)).

c.

Possession, manufacture or distribution of controlled substances. This is punishable by
confinement of up to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million, depending on the schedule
sequence of the controlled substance involved, as well as the amount (See O.C.G.A. Section 1613-30 and Section 16-13-31). The manufacture, distribution or possession with intent to distribute
any controlled substance or marijuana within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school,
park, playground, recreation center, housing project or drug-free commercial zone can result in up
to 40 years in prison with a fine of up to $40,000 (See O.C.G.A. Section 16-13-32.4, 16-13-32.5
and 16-13-32.6). A detailed chart outlining the state penalties for crimes involving various
controlled substances is available in the Student Affairs office.

Federal Laws
1. The Federal drug laws, The Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., are similar to
the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, but contain, for the
most part, more severe penalties. Schedules of controlled substance are established, and it is
made unlawful knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess
with intent to distribute or dispense a controlled substance. If the quantity of controlled
substance is large (e.g. 1,000 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana), the
maximum penalties are life imprisonment, a $4,000,000 fine, or both. Lesser quantities of
controlled substance (e.g. 100 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana) result in
maximum penalties of life imprisonment, a $2,000,000 fine, or both. The distribution of
small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or simple possession of a controlled
substance carries a maximum of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both, with the
penalties for the second offense doubling. Probation without conviction is possible for first
offenders. Distribution to persons under the age of twenty-one by persons eighteen or older
carries double or triple penalties. Double penalties also apply to the distribution or
manufacture of a controlled substance in or on or within 1,000 feet of the property of a school
or college.
2. Students who have been convicted under state or federal law involving the possession or sale
of a controlled substance, are ineligible for federal student aid for specific periods (ranging
from one year to an indefinite period depending on the nature of the offense and whether the
student is a repeat offender).

B. Alcohol
1. The Pennsylvania Liquor Code, 47 Pa., C.S.A., 1-101 et seq., controls the possession and sale
of alcoholic beverages within the Commonwealth. The Code as well as portions of the

DRUG CONVICTION AND FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY

Substance Abuse Question on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
Question 23 on the FAFSA form asks if the student has ever been convicted of a drug related
offense. Failure to answer this question will automatically disqualify the student from receiving
Federal aid. Falsely answering this question, if discovered, could result in fines up to $20,000,
imprisonment, or both.
Under the Higher Education Act, a student may become ineligible for federal student aid upon
conviction of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving Title
IV federal financial aid. Federal aid includes Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans,
Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants, Federal ACG Grants, Federal SMART Grants, Federal TEACH Grants,
Federal Work Study, and Perkins Loans.
FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PENALTIES FOR DRUG CONVICTIONS
Possession of Illegal Drugs:
First Offense: 1 year ineligibility from the date of conviction
Second Offense: 2 years ineligibility from the date of conviction
Third and Subsequent Offenses: Indefinite ineligibility from the date of conviction
Sale of Illegal Drugs:
First Offense: 2 years ineligibility from the date of conviction
Second and Subsequent Offenses: Indefinite ineligibility from the date of conviction
CONVICTIONS DURING ENROLLMENT
According to the United States Department of Education, if a student is convicted of a drug
offense after receiving Federal aid, he or she must notify the Financial Aid Department
immediately and that student will be ineligible for further aid and required to pay back all aid
received after the conviction.
REGAINING ELIGIBILITY
A student can regain eligibility for federal student aid funds by successfully completing a drug
rehabilitation program. To be sufficient to reinstate financial aid eligibility, the program must:
include at least 2 unannounced drug tests AND be recognized as a Federal, State, or local
government agency program. A student will regain eligibility on the date of successfully
completing the program.

Transfer of Credits

Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Programs

PCOM does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application
may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places
available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good
standing at an AOA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine or who is eligible
for re-admission to the previously attended college of osteopathic medicine.
The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or
university from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the
dean of the PCOM campus to which he or she is applying. Application materials
must be submitted and a formal interview with the Faculty Committee on
Admissions will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses
successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM’s curriculum requirements.

Physician Assistant Program

The physician assistant program does not offer advanced placement based upon
transfer of credits for academic work completed at other institutions of higher
learning or upon credit for experiential learning. Applications are not accepted
from graduates of medical schools.

Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program

Students may be able to obtain credit for comparable academic work completed at other
accredited institutions of higher education. Up to six (6) credits may be transferred; all credits
must have been earned with a grade of B or better. All decisions regarding such advanced
standing are made on a case by case basis by the Program Director and the Vice President for
Graduate Programs and Planning.

Counseling and Clinical Health Psychology

A maximum of six (6) credits for graduate courses taken at accredited colleges within the last
five years may be applied toward the M.S. program credit requirements pending approval from
the Program Director. Students must submit course syllabi, instructor credentials, textbooks
used, and official transcripts to the Program Director when applying for transfer credit. Only
classes for which the student received a grade of ‘B’ (3.0) or better will be considered for credit
transfer. The acceptance of transferred credits is subject to the approval of the Program Director.

Master of Science and Educational Specialist in School Psychology

A maximum of six (6) credits for graduate courses taken at accredited colleges within the last
five years may be applied toward the M.S. program credit requirements pending approval from

the Program Director. Students must submit course syllabi, instructor credentials, textbooks
used, and official transcripts to the Program Director when applying for transfer credit. Only
graduate-level courses for which the student received a grade of ‘B’ (3.0) or better will be
considered for credit transfer. The acceptance of transferred credits will be subject to the
approval of the Program Director. While the student may be exempt from taking a minimum of
two courses, he/she is still responsible for the material when taking Comprehensive finals/exams.

Organizational Development and Leadership Program

A maximum of six (6) credits for graduate course study completed at an accredited institution or
in an accredited program within the past five (5) years may be applied toward the ODL degree
requirements. Written approval from the Program Director is required for acceptance of nonODL graduate credits in meeting degree requirements. Students requesting credit transfer must
submit to the Program Director a copy of the course syllabus and the official transcript of each
course completed. Academic course grades of at least ‘B’ (3.0) or ‘pass’ are the minimum level
of acceptance. In most cases, transferred graduate credits will be used to meet Elective course
requirements.

Forensic Medicine Program

In the Department of Pathology, Microbiology, Immunology & Forensic Medicine students may be
able to obtain advanced placement based upon transfer of credits for academic work completed at other
institutions of higher learning up to six (6) graduate credits with a letter grade of “B” or better. Decisions
regarding such advanced standing are made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Department
Chair and the Medical Director and/or Forensic Medicine Director.

Doctor of Psychology Programs

The PsyD in Clinical Psychology program does not accept transfer credits. Students who have
taken a required course prior to matriculation or who believe that through study and experience
they have mastered the requisite knowledge may request to waive a required course. The waiver
should be discussed with the Program Director, and the student should request the course
syllabus and reading list from the Course Instructor. The “Request for Course Waiver” form
must be submitted to the Director of the Psy.D. program and must give the reason for the request
for a waiver at least two weeks prior to the start of the course in discussion. The Director will
determine whether the student is permitted to take a waiver exam. The waiver examination will
be graded as “Waiver” or “No Waiver” by the Director of the Psy.D. program and one other
faculty member. Only one exemption examination may be taken per course. There is no penalty
for not receiving a waiver. Students may waive a maximum of two courses.
Being exempt from/waiving a required course does not lessen the number of credits a student
must take, but rather allows the student to take elective courses in place of the waived courses.
Given that the students in the Psy.D. Program in School Psychology are already trained at the
Ed.S. or Certification level, all students will be able to transfer credits from their Ed.S. or
Certification training into the Psy.D. program. Students will transfer a minimum of 48 credits,
with no more that 12 of those credits being field experience. When transferring credits, it is
important to assess previous training according to the NASP practice and training domains in

order to identify any deficits in current competencies. To accomplish this, all Psy.D. students
must complete the Transfer Course Documentation Form. This form will be completed by each
student and then reviewed and approved by his or her faculty advisor. In cases where students
have not had specific course work in each domain, they are asked to attach to the Transfer
Course Documentation Form a narrative describing how they achieved competence in the
specific area or to remediate by taking the needed course(s)

School of Pharmacy
Georgia Campus does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may
be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class.
Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an ACPE-accredited college
or school of pharmacy who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college or school.
The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or school of pharmacy from
which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM School of
Pharmacy – Georgia Campus. Application materials must be submitted and a formal interview with the
Admissions Committee will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses
successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM’s curriculum requirements.
A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the
PharmD degree.
